# Dodger-Game
this is some starter code for games like Undertale and Osu!. However, it's important to note that different programming languages have different requirements for running and executing code.

For example, languages like C and C++ require the creation of an executable file, which can be run from the terminal. On the other hand, languages like Ruby, C#, Lua, and HTML can be run using a variety of different methods, depending on the specific platform and environment being used.

If you're working with C or C++, you'll need to create an executable file in order to run your code. This can be done using a compiler like GCC or Clang, which can be run from the terminal. Once you've compiled your code into an executable, you can run it from the terminal using a command like "./my_program".

For languages like Ruby, C#, and Lua, you can generally run your code using an interpreter or a virtual machine. For example, you can use the Ruby interpreter to run Ruby code, or the .NET runtime to run C# code. In many cases, these tools can be installed using a package manager like Homebrew on macOS or apt-get on Linux.

Finally, HTML is a markup language used for creating web pages. To run HTML code, you'll need to open it in a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

In terms of starter code for games like Undertale and Osu!, it really depends on the specific programming language and framework you're using. However, there are many resources available online for learning game development, including tutorials, sample code, and open source game engines. Some popular game engines for 2D game development include Unity, Godot, and Construct.
