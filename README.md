# Dodger-Game
this is some starter code for games like Undertale and Osu!. However, it's important to note that different programming languages have different requirements for running and executing code.

For example, languages like C and C++ require the creation of an executable file, which can be run from the terminal. On the other hand, languages like Ruby, C#, Lua, and HTML can be run using a variety of different methods, depending on the specific platform and environment being used.

If you're working with C or C++, you'll need to create an executable file in order to run your code. This can be done using a compiler like GCC or Clang, which can be run from the terminal. Once you've compiled your code into an executable, you can run it from the terminal using a command like "./my_program".

For languages like Ruby, C#, and Lua, you can generally run your code using an interpreter or a virtual machine. For example, you can use the Ruby interpreter to run Ruby code, or the .NET runtime to run C# code. In many cases, these tools can be installed using a package manager like Homebrew on macOS or apt-get on Linux.

Finally, HTML is a markup language used for creating web pages. To run HTML code, you'll need to open it in a web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

In terms of starter code for games like Undertale and Osu!, it really depends on the specific programming language and framework you're using. However, there are many resources available online for learning game development, including tutorials, sample code, and open source game engines. Some popular game engines for 2D game development include Unity, Godot, and Construct.


Kotlin:

1. Install the Kotlin compiler: You can download the Kotlin compiler from the official Kotlin website. The compiler is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. Write your Kotlin code: You can use any text editor to write your Kotlin code. Save your code with the ".kt" file extension.

  Here is an example Kotlin program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:

    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        println("Hello, world!")
    }

3. Compile and run your Kotlin code: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved your Kotlin code, and run the following command:
  
    kotlinc <filename>.kt -include-runtime -d <executable_name>.jar
  
  This will compile your Kotlin code into a Java archive file (.jar). To run the program, use the following command:
  
    java -jar <executable_name>.jar

Swift:

1. Install Xcode: Xcode is the official IDE for developing Swift applications on macOS. You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store.

2. Write your Swift code: Open Xcode, create a new project, and choose the "Command Line Tool" template. Enter a name for your project and select "Swift" as the language. Xcode will create a default Swift file for you.

  Here is an example Swift program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:
  
    print("Hello, world!")

3. Build and run your Swift code: Press the "Play" button in Xcode to build and run your code. The output will be displayed in the Xcode console.
  Alternatively, you can use the Swift command-line tools to compile and run your Swift code outside of Xcode. To do this, save your Swift code to a file with the ".swift" extension, and use the following commands to compile and run your code:
  
    swiftc <filename>.swift -o <executable_name>
  ./<executable_name>

These commands will compile your Swift code into an executable file and run it from the terminal.

  //# hello.rb

puts "Hello, world!"

  To run this program, follow these steps:

Install Ruby: You can download Ruby from the official Ruby website. Ruby is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Save the code: Copy the code above into a file called "hello.rb" and save it on your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt: On Windows, press the "Windows key + R" to open the Run dialog box, type "cmd" and press Enter. On macOS, open the Terminal app.

Navigate to the directory where the code is saved: Use the "cd" command to navigate to the directory where you saved the "hello.rb" file.

For example, if the file is saved on your desktop, you can navigate to the desktop directory by running:
  cd ~/Desktop

Run the program: Type the following command and press Enter:
  ruby hello.rb

 This will run the "hello.rb" program and output "Hello, world!" to the console.

That's it! You've successfully run a Ruby program.
